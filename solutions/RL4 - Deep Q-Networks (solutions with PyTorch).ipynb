    "> The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environment responds to what we do, and we seek to influence what happens through our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence. (Richard S. Sutton)"

    "## <a id=sec5.1></a>Changing the optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of which optimizer to choose is quite open in RL. Most common choices are RMSprop or Adam (with, sometimes, carefully chosen hyperparameters). For the example of cart-pole, it seems Adam with default parameters works better, but that's not a general rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id=sec5.2></a>Several gradient steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that within an iteration of Value Iteration, one aims at minimizing the $L_n(\\theta)$ (before moving on to the next iteration). Why take a single gradient step on this loss when a new sample is collected? Taking several gradient steps can greatly accelerate the convergence in terms of number of collected samples. That's what is commonly called *sample efficiency*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id=sec5.3></a>Target network\n",
    "It appears the code above will (probably) slowly converge to $Q^*$ but this convergence might be unstable and noisy. This can be greatly improved by taking several gradient steps on a given loss function $L_n$ instead of changing the loss function after each sample. This idea is similar to the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is achieved by the introduction of a *target network* whose parameters are noted $\\theta^-$. This idea was introduced in the [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning) paper. At any time step, the loss becomes:\n",
    "$$L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{s,a,r,s'} \\left[ \\left( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a',\\theta^-) - Q(s,a;\\theta) \\right) ^2 \\right],$$\n",
    "and the target network parameters $\\theta^-$ are only updated with the Q-network parameters $\\theta_n$ every $C$ steps and are held fixed between individual updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of accumulating several gradient steps into $\\theta_n$ before updating $\\theta^-$ draws our algorithm closer to a Value Iteration scheme (or a Fitted Q-Iteration scheme for that matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that more recent approaches smooth out this accumulation process by defining soft updates of the form:\n",
    "$$\\theta^- \\leftarrow \\beta \\theta^- + (1-\\beta) \\theta_n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id=sec5.4></a>Error clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common pratice to stabilize learning is to clip the value of the loss' gradient between $-1$ and $1$. This is not such an uncommon trick, it actually amounts to using an L2 loss for values of the loss between $-1$ and $1$ and an L1 loss outside of this domain. This is also know as the [Huber Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) or the [smooth L1 loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#smoothl1loss).\n",

    "**Exercice:** modify you code above to include a target network (with $C$ in the order of $100$), a fixed number of gradient steps per acquired sample, and the clipping of the error term. You can also use Adam for improved efficiency. Then run it to learn an efficient policy for CartPole (then for SwingUp).\n",
