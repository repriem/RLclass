    "> The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environment responds to what we do, and we seek to influence what happens through our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence. (Richard S. Sutton)"

    "A lot of contributions have built on the initial success of DQN. Among those, some are combined and discussed in the **[Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)** paper. We will simply summarize their key ideas here, by decreasing order of importance (according to the paper).\n",

    "- N-step returns. Use samples that accumulate several returns rather than the 1-step return of TD(0).\n",
    "- [Prioritized experience replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952). Inspired by the model-based Prioritized Sweeping approach, bias the distribution used to sample mini-batches in order to present high residual samples to the optimizer. This accelerates the convergence in $L_\\infty$ norm.\n",
    "- [Distributional value functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887). Instead of estimating $\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_t r_t)$, estimate the distribution of $\\sum_t r_t$ and iterate on it.\n",
    "- [NoisyNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295). Instead of an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy, introduce noise in the network's parameters to drive the exploration.\n",
    "- [Dueling architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581). The neural network's architecture splits $Q$ into the estimation of a value $V(s)$ and an advantage $A(s,a)$ with shared first layers.\n",
    "- [Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461). Q-learning is prone to over-estimation of the true optimal Q function (especially in high variance environments). Double Q-learning aims at compensating this weakness by introducing an under-estimation mechanism based on a second Q function.\n",

    "Beyond these improvements, new work is published each year that lead to better understanding of the interplay between Deep Learning and RL."
