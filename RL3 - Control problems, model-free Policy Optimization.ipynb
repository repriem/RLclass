According to the convergence property of Generalized Policy Iteration, this should converge to $Q^*$. But then again, the policy applied by our agent remains totally random so it clearly does not converge to $\\pi^*$.

    "<br>\n",
    "When dealing with environments that have terminal states (such as the holes and the frisbee location here), no transitions will ever be sampled from those states. So a regression method (such as Random Forests) will never see samples starting from $(s,a)$ for a terminal $s$ and therefore will never be informed that it should return zero for any transition starting from $s$. Instead, it will return whatever value it can infer from all the other collected data. But the FQI procedure just ignores that fact: when computing $r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$ for terminal $s'$, it will request a scalar value from the regressor that was never informed that it should return value zero. Often, this will result in giving a non-zero value to transitions starting from terminal states and this will bias the resulting value functions and policies. To avoid this phenomenon, we introduced that `sink_mask` vector that zeroes down the $\\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$ term for any terminal $s'$. The regressor is still not informed that transitions from $s'$ are worth zero but at least we don't propagate this error through the iterations.\n",
